# Description of the functionality provided by this module
Description = '@
A collection of fuctions to simplify logging output in a variety of formats, which includes:
a) Logging simultaneously to the console and a specified log file;
b) Logging to the console and a log file with a time-stamp index at each line;
c) Logging output to only the specified log file.
The Write-ToConsoleAndLog function displays the specified content on both the PowerShell console and an included log file.
The Write-WithTime function displays the specified output on both the PowerShell console and an included log file, with a time index at each line of output.
The Write-ToLogOnly function writes the specified content only to the inlcuded file.
The function here is similar to using the native ...| Out-File -FilePath <path> syntax
